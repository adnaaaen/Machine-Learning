# UnderFitting

Underfitting happens when the model does not learn enough from the data. Underfitting occurs when a machine learning model cannot capture the underlying trend of the data.

### Causes for Underfitting

1. Choosing wrong model
2. Less complexity of the model
3. Less variance but high bias

### Preventing Underfitting by

1. Choosing the correct model appropriate for the problem
2. Increasing the complexity of the model
3. More number of parameters to the model
4. Bias - Variance Tradeoff
