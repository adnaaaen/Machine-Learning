# Loss Function

- Loss function measures how far an estimated value is from its true value.
- The official term for this numerical quantification is the prediction error.
- It is helpful to determine which model performs better & which parameters are better

- Types
  - [Mean Square Error (MSE)](./regression/MSE.md)
  - [Mean Absolute Error (MAE)](./regression/MAE.md)
  - [Binary Cross-Entropy](./classification/binary-cross-entropy.md)
  - [Categorical Cross-Entropy](./classification/categorical-cross-entropy.md)
