# ⛕ ML Model Creation Workflow

➡️ **Data Acquisition**: Gather relevant data for the problem at hand

➡️ **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure quality and usability

➡️ **Exploratory Analysis**: Analyze the data to determine the most suitable model or approach

➡️ **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate model based on the data and problem requirements

➡️ **Model Training**: Train the selected model using the training dataset

➡️ **Model Testing**: Test the model on unseen data to evaluate its performance

➡️ **Performance Evaluation**: Assess the model using relevant evaluation metrics

➡️ **Deployment**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
