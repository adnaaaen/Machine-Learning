# ML Model Creation Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition**  
   Gather relevant data for the problem at hand.

2. **Data Preparation**  
   Clean and preprocess the data to ensure quality and usability.

3. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   Analyze the data to determine the most suitable model or approach.

4. **Model Selection**  
   Choose an appropriate model based on the data and problem requirements.

5. **Model Training**  
   Train the selected model using the training dataset.

6. **Model Testing**  
   Test the model on unseen data to evaluate its performance.

7. **Performance Evaluation**  
   Assess the model using relevant evaluation metrics.

8. **Deployment**  
   Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
