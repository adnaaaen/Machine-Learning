Welcome to my **Machine Learning Notes** repository! This is a living document where I record my learning journey in machine learning. Contributors are welcome to enhance and expand these notes.

I continuously update this repository as I learn more-currently, Iâ€™m at the **Linear Regression** stage.

## Why These Notes

These notes aim to:

- Simplify complex machine learning concepts.
- Provide a step-by-step learning path for aspiring ML enthusiasts.
- Offer Python code implementations from scratch to build a solid understanding of models and algorithms.

> [!NOTE]
> Pre-requisites:
> Before diving into machine learning, make sure you are familiar with essential data skills like:  
>
> - Data Analysis
> - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
> - Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
> - Feature Engineering
