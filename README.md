# Machine Learning
- In simple words machine learning is we are teach machine to perform a specific task by learning from data.

## Type's Of Machine Learning
1. ## Supervised Learning
     - Models learn from labeled data
     - Types
         - **Classification**
             - Model Predict Discrete value
             - e.g. either that is Dog or Cat
             - Algorithms: `Logistic Regression` `k-Nearest Neighbors` `Support Vector Machine` `Decision Tree Classifier` `Random Forest Classifier` `Naive Bayes`
         - **Regression**
             - Model Predict Continues value
             - e.g. predict the quantity of the rain
             - Algorithms: `Linear Regression` `Lasso Regression` `Polynomial Regression` `Support Vector Machine Regressor` `Random Forest Regressor` `Bayesian Linear Regression`
2. ## Unsupervised Learning
   - Model learn from unlabeled data (dataset does not contain a target variable)
   - Trying to understand hidden pattern, clusters or structures from the data
   - Types
       - **Clustering**
           - Grouping similar data points
           - e.g. Anomali detection
           - Algorithms: `K-Means Clustering` `Hierarchical Clustering` `Density Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (DBSCAN)`
       - **Dimensionality Reduction**
           - Reduce no.of feature or dimensions
           - Algorithms: `Principal Component Analysis (PCA)` `t-SNE`
       - **Assosiation**
           - Discover interesting relationship or pattern a set of items in a large dataset
           - e.g. Recommendation Systems
           - Algorithms: `Apriori Algorithm` `FP-Growth`
4. ## Reinforcement Learning
   - An Agent learns by interacting with an environment and receving rewards or penalties based on its actions
   - e.g. GameAi, Robotics
