Welcome to my **Machine Learning Notes** repository! This is a living document where I record my learning journey in machine learning. Contributors are welcome to enhance and expand these notes.

I continuously update this repository as I learn more-currently, Iâ€™m at the **Logistic Regression** stage.

Feel free to explore and contribute! ðŸŽ‰

## Why These Notes?

These notes aim to:

- Simplify complex machine learning concepts.
- Provide a step-by-step learning path for aspiring ML enthusiasts.
- Offer Python code implementations from scratch to build a solid understanding of models and algorithms.

> **Pre-requisites:**  
Before diving into machine learning, make sure you are familiar with essential data skills like:  

- **Data Analysis**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**
- **Feature Engineering**
